ola guys!
Welcome to Naganohara! My name is Yoimiya â€” just let me know if you need anything! We have Kushikatsu, Egg Roll... Wait, no, we're not a restaurant. We make fireworks! Like these, see? Sparkling, crackling, little fireworks~
 Spark Knight Klee of the Knights of Favonius, reporting for duty! ...There's some more, but uh, I forgot. I'm not so good at remembering...
  "Explosion inside city wall, grounded be thy woe," "Explosions can hurt people, Jean can be dreadful," "Mondstadt be bombed, Klee be doomed." Those're the survival rules that the Knights of Favonius gave me.
